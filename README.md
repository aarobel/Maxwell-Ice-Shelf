# Maxwell-Ice-Shelf

This is a simple MATLAB implementation of the lumped Maxwell model for an ice shelf described in Robel et al., Annals of Glaciology, 2017.

See LumpedMaxwellModel.m for model itself, MaxwellTides_Figure1.m for code to produce Figure 1 and MaxwellTides_Figure3.m for code to produce Figure 3. The GPS data and reader scripts (ReadLocalXYZ.m) used in these two figure scripts were obtained from Bob Bindschadler and Hilmar Gudmundsson.

Code written by Alex Robel, last update August 2017.
